Verifying Character Ordering
Given a string s representing a new ordering of the lowercase English letters and an array A[] of strings,
return true if and only if A[] is sorted in lexicographical order according to the ordering provided in s.


Example #1:
Input: s = "hlbcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxzya", A[] = ["hello", "hey", "a"].
Output: true
Explanation: Under the new ordering, the array A[] is sorted. Note that the letter 'h'
comes before the letter 'a', and the letter 'l' comes before the letter 'y'.
